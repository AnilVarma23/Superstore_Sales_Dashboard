# Superstore Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains the data and documentation for the Superstore Sales Dashboard, a project that analyzes sales data for a fictional superstore. The dataset has been cleaned using Microsoft Excel, and visualizations have been created using Power BI to provide actionable insights into sales performance.

## Data Cleaning Process
The raw Superstore dataset was cleaned using Microsoft Excel with the following steps:
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
- Handled missing values by either filling them with appropriate defaults or removing incomplete records.
- Standardized date formats for consistency.
- Corrected inconsistencies in categorical data (e.g., region names, payment modes).

## Visualization
The cleaned data was imported into Power BI to create an interactive Sales Dashboard. Key visualizations include:
- **Total Net Sales and Profit**: Displays current and previous year figures.
- **Sales Revenue Distribution Monthwise**: Line chart comparing net sales over months.
- **Profit Distribution Monthwise**: Line chart showing profit trends.
- **Net Sales by State**: Choropleth map highlighting sales distribution across states.
- **Sales by Category and Sub-Category**: Bar charts comparing current and previous year sales.
- **Sales by Region, Payment Mode, Segment, and Ship Mode**: Pie and bar charts for detailed breakdowns.
- **Average Order Value and Order Quantity**: Key performance indicators.

## Usage
1. Open the Power BI file (`Sales_Dashboard.pbix`) to explore the interactive dashboard.
2. Use the filters (Year, Region) to analyze specific data segments.
3. Refer to the Excel file (`Superstore_Cleaned.xlsx`) for the cleaned dataset.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Excel (for viewing/editing the cleaned dataset).
- Power BI Desktop (for interacting with the dashboard).
